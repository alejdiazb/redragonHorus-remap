Remap any key , including FN ,modifying and adding keys to  FN layer

Read instructons to determine if your keyboard supports this method

Instuctions explain how to use the K-MAP and Hex Output files for
making your very own custom remap of keys by modifying the cfg.ini file
(cfg.ini is located in the installation directroy of your keyboard software)

The modifications are applied through the software provided
by the manufacturer (check out 'how to' in instructions )

Personally tested on Redragon k617!
I have provided modified cfg file for K617 adding
media keys and remappig FN

# Probably compatible keyboards --

 -HK gaming GK61

 -Eyooso Z-11(redragon k617 clone , cross compatible  cfg files and software)

 -cosmic  byte themis

 -(any keyboard with software using described cfg.ini file)

 **NOTE:**
 Most of these keyboards use BYK916/SH68F90A MCU , the provided OEM softwares are all almost similar with a changed Skin on top. Although few of them I belive use a totally different firmware (like RD K630?) and are not compatable with this approach. There is the [SMK](https://github.com/carlossless/smk) Project for such Keyboards and the boards using BYK916 / BYK901 / SH68F90A MCU in general. It aims to add much greater functionality by flashing a custom firmware. Do take a backup of the MCU Flash contents before proceeding using [sinowealth-kb-tool](https://github.com/carlossless/sinowealth-kb-tool).
